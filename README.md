 The application helps you search information relate to languages and technologies. Currently, this application just supports three sources: [StackOverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) - [Confreaks](http://confreaks.tv/) with simple features.

I would like to develop this application become the powerful application like as *Gaea, a god in Greek mythology was the great mother of all.*

**Here is my todo-list:**

- Add more features for three sources, for example: paginates, search from tags, video, display more information for each result. I believe we will have more features when work with APIs of above sources.

- Extend to more sources: StackExchange or Google services such as [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/), [Super User](http://superuser.com/), [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/), [Google Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/) ...
